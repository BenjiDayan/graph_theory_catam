Code for a part II maths CATAM project on analysing randomly constructed graphs. Extensively used the networkx python graph theory package.
- graph_algorithms.py has algorithms for e.g. finding the clique number of a graph
- graph_outputs.py is for plotting graphs and directly answering the questions of the project
- graph_utils.py has supporting utility functions
